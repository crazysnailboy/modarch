# Modern Architecture Mod for Minecraft

This mod adds 33 new decorative blocks to Minecraft: 16 colors of drywall, 16 colors of concrete, and a steel truss. All can be crafted inexpensively with vanilla ingredients.

It's built against Minecraft 1.4.7, which means it plays nicely with popular mods like IndustrialCraft. If there is sufficient interest, I will try to find time to make a version for 1.5.1.

## Download

[modarch.jar](https://github.com/jarrett/modarch/blob/master/bin/modarch.jar) for MC 1.4.7

## Installation

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Universal) if you don't already have it. FYI, if you have IndustrialCraft, BuildCraft, or RedPower installed, you already have Forge.

modarch.jar goes in the mods folder. If you don't know what this means, I recommend installing [MultiMc](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1000645-multimc-43-windows-linux-mac/), which automates a lot of the drudgery of installing mods. Once you have MultiMC installed, create a new Minecraft 1.4.7 instance, right click it, select "Edit Mods," click the "Mods Folder" tab, click "Add," and select modarch.jar. You're done!

This mod was built against Forge version 6.6.0.497. If you are using a different version of Forge and run into any errors, please try installing 6.6.0.497.

If you have any questions about installing this mod, please feel free to contact me. Just remember, it's only compatible with MC 1.4.7.
